# Riak-KV-Healthcare
A web application for Health-Care Tracking system integrating interfaces for the health-care provider, the patient and the pharmacist. 

IMPORTANT:
I have replaced my earlier code - temporarily - with an Axure RP interactive prototype file. You will need to install Axure RP in your machine to get the ".rp" file up and running. 
The interactive prototype is hardly extensive. It should be treated as a skill demonstrator for Axure wireframing / prototyping work.

WHY THE EARLIER CODE WAS REMOVED?
To put it bluntly, it is not working and I didn't want to debug it further right away. Probably because I used this for utilizing Riak KV data store released by Basho way back in 2016. 

Next thing you know - Basho goes belly up a few months later in 2017. Well, I smugly assumed I wouldn't need to worry about it. And here we are....

Anyhow, coming back to the main point. If you need someone who can do some UX work and need someone who is skilled in Axure RP tool, I am your guy. I am providing my LinkedIn id and phone number at the end. 

As far as, the original code is concerned, I am throwing it out for good. I am gonna reimplement this project in my spare time(I intend to redo it again using React in the front end, but I will probably use Dynamo DB in the backend) . I don't know how long that's gonna take as I am focussing heavily on the UX Research and Design aspect of stuff right now because of my interests.
